A repository of 3 projects in statistics - William ELKIESS


- Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on a Large Dataset

  Data: Accidents in the U.S from 2016-2023 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data

  The objective was to uncover insights, identify patterns and understand the factors associted with accidents

  Data Cleaning / Spatial Analysis States Cities and Roads / Temporal Anaysis / Weather and Environmental Factors / Severity



- Project 2: Machine Learning Project 

  Data: IT Customer Churn (Imbalanced Dataset) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soheiltehranipour/it-customer-churn/data

  The objective was to analyse the data, identify the key factors that influence customer churn and finally build ML models to predict customer churn

  Data Cleaning / Data Visualising / Transforming the Data / Assessing Data Imbalance (SMOTE) / Creating a Function to Find the Best Hyperparameters for each Model (GridSearchCV) / Training ML Models

  Decision Trees / Random Forest / XGBoost / Log Reg / MLP
  

- Project 3: Time Series Analysis / Price Forecasting Project 

  Data: Reatil Sales Forecasting https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tevecsystems/retail-sales-forecasting/data

  The objective is to predict future sales of this retailer. We focus on building 2 models to forecast the sales of the last 30 days of this dataset 

  Data Cleaning / Plot Sales / Identify Patterns / Stationarity, Trend, Seasonality, Residuals / Building a SARIMA model / Creating a Function to Find the Best Hyperparameters (GridSearchCV) for XGBoost / Forecasting Sales
